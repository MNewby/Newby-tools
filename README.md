Newby-tools
===========
A suite of custom astronomy tools

This is the migration of my scripts and code snippets from 
the SVN repository on Fornax to a more accessible github repo.

Many of these scripts are outdated, ugly, disheveled, poorly-documented, etc.
They'll get cleaned up with time.
Until then, use at your own risk!
